# Flood-Hazard-Analysis-using-UP-NOAH-Dataset

The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters. The latest [World Risk Index 2023](https://weltrisikobericht.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WorldRiskReport_2023_english_online.pdf) assessment ranked the Philippines with the highest disaster risk worldwide. Geographically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the country is prone to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and notably typhoons. The [DOST-PAGASA ](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/climate/tropical-cyclone-information) stated that the country experiences an average of 20 typhoons annually with 8 to 9 making landfall.

Typhoons often lead to significant flooding, particularly in low-lying and coastal areas, which displaces thousands of people and leads to loss of life and property. Early warning systems, disaster risk reduction programs, and coping facilities are necessary to strengthen disaster preparedness measures. One such program is **Project NOAH** (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazard), a disaster prevention and mitigation system that includes geo-hazard vulnerability maps that identify flood-prone areas throughout the country. 

We use the UP Resilience Institute (UPRI) [NOAH Open Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K2z1FYNCGPzhcGIgT1Y2nKKLUojxxIa3) to analyze the hazard level of cities across Metro Manila.
